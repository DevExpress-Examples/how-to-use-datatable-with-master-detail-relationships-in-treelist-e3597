# How to use DataTable  with  master-detail relationships in TreeList.


<p>This example demonstrates how to use DataTable with the master-detail relationship in TreeList</p><p>The XtraTreeList control provides different mechanisms (<a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument305"><u>Data Binding Modes</u></a>) to display data. <br />
When DataTable is assigned to the TreeList DataSource property (<a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument5555"><u>Bound Mode</u></a>) TreeList can show data only from the underlying DataTable and does not take into account datasource relations.  <br />
To show related data in TreeList, use the  <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument178"><u>Dynamic Loading in Unbound Mode</u></a> or the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument5560"><u>Dynamic Data Loading in an Events mode</u></a>.</p>
